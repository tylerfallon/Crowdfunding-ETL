# Crowdfunding-ETL

The purpose of this repository is to extract, transform, and load data using a combination of Pandas, SQL queries, and more in Python. We compared the relationships of various tables with one another using a database schema and an ERD logical diagram. This allowed us to easily generate the SQL queries necessary to generate the tables in PostgreSQL.
